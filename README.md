- `dispute-transaction`: Challenge potentially fraudulent transfers

## Installation & Setup

1. Ensure you have Clarinet installed on your system.
2. Clone the GridFlow repository: `git clone https://github.com/gridflow/gridflow.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd gridflow`
4. Install the project dependencies: `npm install`
5. Run the Clarinet development environment: `clarinet dev`

## Usage Guide

### Participant Registration
```clarity
(register-participant 'ABCD1234 PARTICIPANT-TYPE-PRODUCER "location-data")
```

### Energy Trading
```clarity
;; List energy for sale
(create-energy-listing u1000 u500 PRICING-FIXED u0)

;; Purchase energy
(purchase-energy u1)

;; Place bid (for auction listings)
(place-bid u1 u550)
```

### Energy Token Operations
```clarity
;; Transfer energy tokens
(transfer u100 tx-sender 'RECIPIENT none)

;; Check balance
(get-balance 'ADDRESS)
```

### Smart Meter Integration
```clarity
;; Register a smart meter
(register-meter 0x1234 METER-TYPE-PRODUCER "location")

;; Submit reading
(submit-energy-reading 0x1234 block-height u100 0xSIGNATURE)
```

## Security Considerations

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Strict permissions for critical operations
- **Escrow System**: Secure trade settlement with funds in escrow
- **Verified Meters**: Only registered and verified meters can submit readings
- **Dispute Resolution**: Formal process for handling disputes
- **Multi-Stage Settlement**: Phased completion of trades with verification steps

## Examples

### Complete Trading Cycle
```clarity
;; 1. Create energy listing
(create-energy-listing u1000 u500 PRICING-FIXED u0)

;; 2. Purchase energy
(purchase-energy u1)

;; 3. Confirm delivery
(confirm-delivery u1)

;; 4. Settle payment
(settle-payment u1)
```

### Meter Reading Verification
```clarity
;; 1. Submit reading
(submit-energy-reading 0x1234 block-height u100 0xSIGNATURE)

;; 2. Verify reading
(verify-reading 0x1234 block-height true "Verification notes")
```

### Token Operations
```clarity
;; Mint tokens to producer
(mint u1000 'PRODUCER_ADDRESS)

;; Transfer tokens
(transfer u100 tx-sender 'CONSUMER_ADDRESS none)
```

The enhanced GridFlow system provides a complete solution for decentralized energy trading, from participant registration to final settlement, with robust security measures and dispute resolution mechanisms.
